                “The most impressive aspect about Melanie’s teaching was her warm and caring demeanor with the students. From the first day of class, the students would corral around her and yearned for a minute of connection. She always made each and every student feel loved, accepted, and capable of success. Melanie was able to present information on a wide variety of topics while projecting a composed presence, a great sense of humor, and most importantly, a positive classroom management.”
